# LoEUpdateLog
Prototype system. If you don't know what this is for, that's expected.

Dynamically loading update log information from this github page instead of from the game description as I do on Eternal Moon.

# Version Formatting

Version Formatting is based on the standard [Semantic Version](https://semver.org/) format, with some slight modifications to the definitions of the parts.

The format is: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` where...
`MAJOR` now represents major updates to the game, like large-scale content drops that add item sets or zones to the game, updates worth events or entire advertising schemes over.
`MINOR` now represents minor updates to the game, like major bug fixes, major stat or balance changes, or adding small scale things e.g. individual items / cosmetic extensions to items.
`PATCH` now represents small-scale fixes like minor bugfixes (e.g. typo in a GUI), minor stat or balance tweaks, or altering the appearance of existing items on a small scale.
