# LoEUpdateLog
Prototype system. If you don't know what this is for, that's expected.

Dynamically loading update log information from this github page instead of from the game description as I do on Eternal Moon.

# Version Formatting

Version Formatting is based on the standard [Semantic Version](https://semver.org/) format, with some slight modifications to the definitions of the parts to better fit the nature of the project.

The format is: `TAG MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` where...
* `TAG` represents the main game version. This will either be `Indev`, `Alpha`, `Beta`, or nothing for the released game.
* `MAJOR` now represents major updates to the game, like large-scale content drops that add item sets or zones to the game, updates worth events or entire advertising schemes over.
* `MINOR` now represents minor updates to the game, like major bug fixes, major stat or balance changes, or adding small scale things e.g. individual items / cosmetic extensions to items.
* `PATCH` now represents small-scale fixes like minor bugfixes (e.g. typo in a GUI), minor stat or balance tweaks, or altering the appearance of existing items on a small scale.

### Tag format
* `Indev` represents private development. This stage is private and is when the game is being first created. It is similar to an alpha, but the project is not in a workable state that can be considered playable in any way.
* `Alpha` represents alpha-state development. This stage is when the game is playable but a lot of stuff is still being changed and determined.
* `Beta` represents beta-state development. This stage is when the game is nearing its finalized steps before its release.
* No tag represents the release version.
